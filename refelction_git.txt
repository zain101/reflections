Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file
separately?
A ==> Git provides flexibility of both.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? 
A==> git log gives the log of all the commits uptill now . git diff compare the two commit by taking their commit id .

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A==> Because GIT allows to be flexible with commit timeline it provides, to revert  to the changes in past where things were great. 
     git cheokout id allows to go into the past and future of time (note : please save the resent commit ID)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
A==? for current project.
